\begin{frame}{Details + Explanation}

Let's go over the syllabus!

\begin{itemize}
\item What this class is about: this is my first time teaching it, so there is a lot of space for adjustment.

\item Basic programming skills = you know \textit{some} language and can write a short program. Extra helpful if you can make functions/subroutines.

\item I give bonus points for
  \begin{itemize}
  \item submitting a pull request to correct course notes
  \item submitting your homework as a link to a Git repo (note: I still need to be able to figure out what on earth you did)
  \end{itemize}
If you don't know how to use Git...
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{References \& Resources}

\begin{itemize}
\item The links in the syllabus are clickable; many are repeated in the helpful resources page.

\item There are a lot of books listed: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item some are available electronically
  \item I have extra copies of Lewis \& Miller in my office for loan
  \item mostly you'll just use course notes 
  \end{itemize}

\item I haven't actually decided if we'll use MCNP. If you're interested in it for a final project (a) request access now, (b) you might want to request exe only, (c) I won't let you use MCNP for a final project unless you already have experience with it or you make a very compelling case.

\begin{frame}{Solving Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify the problem
\item Pose the problem in terms of a mathematical model
\item Identify a computational method for solving the model
\item Implement the computational method on a computer
\item Assess the answer in the context of the
\begin{itemize}
\item Implementation (computer language and architecture)
\item Method (discrete or continuous)
\item Model (symbolic or numerical)
\end{itemize}
Using
\begin{itemize}
\item Visualization and interpretation
\item Experimental comparisons
\item Analytical comparisons
\item Engineering judgement
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Identify the Problem}
What are we trying to accomplish?
\begin{itemize}
\item The challenge of designing a nuclear reactor is to make it as \textbf{economical} as possible while ensuring its \textbf{safety}. \vspace*{1 em}

\pause
\item The principle of a nuclear reactor is relatively simple:
\begin{itemize}
\item \underline{Fission} creates heat within the nuclear fuel,
\item The \underline{heat} is conducted to the fuel cladding surface and to the coolant,
\item The heat is subsequently transported by a coolant through heat exchangers and ultimately to a \underline{steam} conversion plant.
\end{itemize}
\vspace*{1 em}

\pause
\item Many scales, physics, and systems are involved (read: complex)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Identify the Problem}
\begin{itemize}
\item In order to design economical and safe reactors, one must choose among a vast range of competing designs:
\begin{itemize}
\item What are the \alert{best} fuels, structure, and coolant materials; what are their appropriate ratios?
\item How does the reactor respond to component failures?
\item How does one balance those choices given competing goals of performance, lifetime, safety, and capital cost? 
\vspace*{1 em}
\end{itemize}
\item Ideally, one would like to base these choices on theory rather than experimental trial and error 
\vspace*{1 em}
\item This is where \textcolor{dgreen}{predictive computing} fits in...
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Predictive Computing}

The idea behind \alert{predictive computing} is to have
\begin{itemize}
\item a mathematical model that is sufficiently representative
\item \textit{and} methods that are sufficiently accurate
\item \textit{and} an implementation this is sufficiently robust
\end{itemize}
\pause
such that \alert{calculations} can
\begin{itemize}
\item inform experiment design
\item \textit{and} replace experiments
\item \textit{and be so reliable that we can make new design choices using only calculations}.
\end{itemize}
\vspace*{1 em}
We will only look at one piece needed for predictive computing...

   &+ \int_0^{\infty} dE' \int_{4\pi} d\vOmega' \:\Macro_{s}(\vec{r}, E' \to E, \vOmega' \cdot \vOmega) \psi(\vec{r}, \vOmega', E')  \nonumber

\begin{frame}{Historical Context}
\begin{itemize}
\item Computing limitations of the past caused
\begin{itemize}
\item Heavy reliance on expensive and often complicated experiments
\item Inaccuracy resulted in \emph{significant design margins} $\rightarrow$ negative impact on plant economics
\item Exploration of novel reactor design concepts was greatly constrained by fundamental limitations in the predictability of the models
\vspace*{1 em}
\end{itemize}
\item Many codes (methods+implementation) developed then are still used 
\pause
\item Can we update these tools or do we need new ones?
\pause
\item What \textit{methods} will take us into the future?
\pause
\item What will the architectures look like?
\pause
\item What and how do we need to include other physics?

%"Traditionally, reactor models for radiation dose assessments have considered just the reactor core, or a small part of the core," Wagner says. "However, we're now simulating entire nuclear facilities, such as a nuclear power reactor facility with its auxiliary buildings and the ITER fusion reactor, with much greater accuracy than any other organization that we're aware of." 
%
%More accurate models enable nuclear plants to be designed with more accurate safety margins and shielding requirements, which helps to improve safety and reduce costs. The technology that makes this sort of leading-edge simulation possible is a combination of ORNL's Jaguar, the world's fastest supercomputer; advanced transport methods; and a next-generation software package called Denovo.
